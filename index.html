										</aside>
									
									an automobile client was looking to improve the efficiency and return on investment (ROI) for their marketing campaigns across different media channels. The client was likely facing challenges such as limited budgets, difficulty in measuring the impact of different media streams on sales, and a need to optimize their media mix to achieve their desired business goals. The project aimed to address these challenges by building a Media Mix Model (MMM) using Linear Regression, developing an optimization algorithm to allocate budget effectively, and creating a simulator tool to simulate different scenarios and gain insights into potential outcomes. The project also involved building a data pipeline to ensure that the model was fed with accurate and relevant data. <br>

										</aside>									
										The objective of the Media Mix Model (MMM) project for the automobile client is to improve the efficiency and return on investment (ROI) of their marketing campaigns across different media channels. This can be achieved by developing a data-driven MMM that uses Linear Regression to analyze the impact of different media streams on sales, and developing an optimization algorithm that optimizes budget allocation across these media streams based on the model coefficients. The objective is also to create a simulator tool that allows the client to simulate different scenarios and gain insights into potential outcomes, and to build a data pipeline to ensure that the MMM is fed with accurate and relevant data. Ultimately, the objective is to help the client achieve their desired business goals through a more effective use of their marketing resources.<br>
										<br>

											• Analyze the client's business goals and marketing objectives to determine the scope of the MMM project.<br>
											• Collect and organize data from various sources, such as advertising spend, website traffic, and sales data, to feed into the MMM.<br>
											• Develop and implement a Linear Regression model to analyze the impact of different media streams on sales, and optimize the model using tools such as AWS SageMaker and Athena.<br>
											• Develop an optimization algorithm to allocate budget effectively across different media streams based on the model coefficients.<br>
											• Create a simulator tool that allows the client to simulate different scenarios and gain insights into potential outcomes of different budget allocations and media mixes.<br>
											• Build a data pipeline to ensure that the MMM is fed with accurate and relevant data, and automate data cleaning and processing as much as possible.<br>
											• Present findings and recommendations to the client and provide ongoing support to ensure successful implementation of the MMM and optimization algorithm.<br>

									<br>
									<aside>
										<b style="font-size: 14px; color: #03425E">Problem Background : </b> 
										</aside>
									
									The problem background for this project is that the company was likely facing challenges in optimizing their vehicle incentives and discounts to improve sales performance. Incentives are often used in the automotive industry to encourage customers to purchase vehicles by providing discounts, rebates, and other offers. However, determining the right level of incentives to offer to different customer segments can be challenging, as it involves balancing the need to attract customers with the need to maintain profitability. The project aimed to address these challenges by developing an incentive optimization model using a four-stage modeling approach that includes micro-segmentation, elasticity and passthrough rate prediction, and optimized allocation. The model aimed to improve incentive optimization and sales performance by using analytics-driven discount steering. The project had a pan-India scope, indicating that it was likely aimed at optimizing incentives and discounts for all vehicles sold across the country. <br>

										<b style="font-size: 14px; color: #03425E">Objective : </b> 
										</aside>									
										The objective of the "Incentive Steering (Price Elasticity)" or "Pricing and Vehicle Incentive Steering Analytics" project is to optimize the incentives and discounts offered to customers to improve sales performance while maintaining profitability. This can be achieved by developing an analytics-driven incentive optimization model using a four-stage modeling approach, which includes micro-segmentation, elasticity and passthrough rate prediction, and optimized allocation. The objective is to leverage data and analytics to determine the right level of incentives to offer to different customer segments to maximize sales while minimizing the impact on profitability. The project also aimed to ensure successful implementation of the analytical model across the company's operations in India by collaborating with cross-functional teams. Ultimately, the objective is to improve the company's sales performance and profitability by offering the right incentives to the right customers at the right time.<br>
										<br>
										<aside>
											<b style="font-size: 14px; color: #03425E">Roles and Responsibilities : </b> <br>

											• Develop and implement a four-stage modeling approach that includes micro-segmentation, elasticity and passthrough rate prediction, and optimized allocation to determine the right level of incentives to offer to different customer segments.<br>
											• Prepare data using the PySpark framework, merge datasets to obtain an exhaustive dataset for each vehicle sold, and use AWS SageMaker, Athena, and EC2 instance to develop and train the model.<br>
											• Coordinate with the field team during the pilot run and fine-tune the analytics model to ensure that it works effectively in a real-world setting.<br>
											• Use advanced Excel and other tools to present findings and recommendations to the client and provide ongoing support to ensure successful implementation of the model.<br>
											• Ensure that data is accurate and up-to-date by building data pipelines and automating data cleaning and processing as much as possible.<br>
											• Work with the client to identify key performance indicators (KPIs) and track the model's performance against these metrics.<br>
											• Monitor and evaluate the model's performance and make adjustments as necessary to improve its effectiveness in achieving the client's business goals.<br>
